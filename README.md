<h1>Sales Forecast for a Clothing Brand</h1>

<h2>Project Description and Scope</h2>
The project's objective was to use the Holt-Winters method of multiplicative seasonality to illustrate how this model can be a useful tool for companies who want to accurately predict future sales in scenarios where seasonality is involved. The model we created was able to accurately predict sales for our fictional company, LS Clothing Inc, which experiences a cyclical seasonality trend with elevated sales every 4 months because of merch drops. This project should serve as a useful tool for businesses who want to accurately predict trends that involve multiplicative seasonality.
